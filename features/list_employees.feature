Feature: List employees
  As a manager
  I want to see a list of employees
  So that I can view their details

  Scenario: Viewing the list of employees
    Given the following employees exist:
      | name       | salary | position  | admission_date | dismissal_date | password | password_confirmation | birth_date |
